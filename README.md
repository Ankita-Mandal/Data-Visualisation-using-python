# Data-Visualisation-using-python
Data Visualisation of a Student Performance dataset using matplotlib and seaborn python libraries. \

# Objectives of the Project:/
- Understand how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by the other variables (Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch, Test preparation course).\
- Understand the connection between the variables and to uncover the underlying structure.\
- Detect anomalies.\
- Test the underlying assumptions.\
- Provide insights with suitable graphs and visualizations.\
- Write all inferences with supporting Analysis and Visualizations.\

# Variables and their description: 
- gender                          : Gender of the student\
-race/ethnicity                   : Race of the Student As Group A/B/C\
